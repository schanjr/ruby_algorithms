# frozen_string_literal: true

# Dijkstra’s algorithm (pronounced “dike’ struh”)
# Also known asTraveling salesman problem
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVfj6mxhdMw
#
#
## Start ##
# Let distance of start vertex from start vertex = 0
# Let distance of all other vertices from start = infinity

## Algorithm ##
# WHILE vertices remain unvisited
#   Visit unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the start vertex (call this the current vertex)
#   FOR each unvisited neighbour of the currente vertex
#     Calculate the distance from the start vertex
#     If the calculated distance of this vertex is less than the known distance
#       Update the shortest distance of this vertex
#       Update the previous vertex with the current vertex
#     end if
#     NEXT unvisited neighbour
#     Add the current vertex to the list of visited vertices
# END WHILE
