# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/
# Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

# @example
#  Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
#  Output: "BANC"
#  Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
#
#  Input: s = "a", t = "a"
#  Output: "a"
#  Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
#
#  Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
#  Output: ""
#  Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
#  Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
